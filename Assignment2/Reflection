During my visit to UTMDigital, I was profoundly impressed by the extensive digital services provided by Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM).
The offerings, such as MyUTM Data Centre and UTMSmart, are comprehensive and well-structured to cater to student needs.
I found the website user-friendly and easy to navigate, although there were minor areas that could be improved for an enhanced user experience.

One of the most enlightening aspects of my visit was learning about the data centre. 
I discovered that the secrecy surrounding the data centre is not primarily due to fears of hacking, but rather for business purposes.
This was a revelation that shifted my perspective on data security and business strategy. 
Additionally, I learnt about the critical need for the data centre to be constantly air-conditioned and kept cold to prevent short circuits, emphasizing the importance of a controlled environment in maintaining the integrity of digital services.

This visit has significantly broadened my understanding of the digital resources available at UTM and piqued my interest in the realm of digital technology.
It underscored the importance of staying abreast with the latest digital trends, which can greatly augment my academic journey. 
In conclusion, the visit to UTMDigital was an enlightening experience that will undoubtedly have a positive impact on my future endeavors at UTM
