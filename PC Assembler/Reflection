Reflecting on my hands-on experience in the PC lab, disassembling and then reassembling a computer, I am filled with a newfound appreciation for the intricacies of computer hardware.
This hands-on experience gave me a clear understanding of the inner workings of a PC. 
I learned about the role and function of each component, and how they all fit together. 
The process was challenging, especially keeping track of every part and ensuring correct connections. 
However, overcoming these challenges was rewarding and taught me valuable skills like patience and attention to detail. 
Overall, this experience has enriched my knowledge of computer hardware and has been a significant step in my learning journey.
